She was also closely involved with various community outreach work through facilitating tours for high school students and presenting at conferences that encourage women and students of color to pursue a career in STEM. Prior to Facebook, Carmen was an active community organizer at the University of California Berkeley, where she held various leadership roles under REACH! (Bridges) and ANova.
